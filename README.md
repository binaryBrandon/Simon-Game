# Simon-Game

A simple version of the color pattern matching game "Simon". 4 squares are displayed on the screen and a random sequence is shown to the player. The player must click the correct squares in the correct order to advance to the next level.

Written with JavaScript/HTML/CSS.

Todo: change nextSequence() in game.js so that the entire series is displayed to the player (much like how traditional "Simon" plays).
